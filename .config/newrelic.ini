# This file configures the New Relic Python Agent.
#
# The path to the configuration file should be supplied to the function
# newrelic.agent.initialize() when the agent is being initialized.
#
# The configuration file follows a structure similar to what you would
# find for Microsoft Windows INI files. For further information on the
# configuration file format see the Python ConfigParser documentation at:
#
#    http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html
#
# For further discussion on the behaviour of the Python agent that can
# be configured via this configuration file see:

# Here are the settings that are common to all environments.

# Relic account. This key binds the Python Agent's data to your
# account in the New Relic service.

# newrelic.com. This global switch is normally overridden for

# High Security Mode enforces certain security settings, and
# prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data
# is sent to New Relic. Enabling High Security Mode means that
# SSL is turned on, request parameters are not collected, and SQL
# can not be sent to New Relic in its raw form. To activate High
# Security Mode, it must be set to 'true' in this local .ini
# configuration file AND be set to 'true' in the server-side
# configuration in the New Relic user interface. For details, see
# https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/subscriptions/high-security

# Tells the transaction tracer and error collector (when
# enabled) whether or not to capture the query string for the

# Apdex controller action - four times the Apdex T value.

# When the transaction tracer is on, SQL statements can
# optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes, "off"
